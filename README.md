# Puzzle Solver Extensions

Originally created just for the puzzle-xyz.com pages, and later expanded to other sites/pages. 

## Puzzle Sites

### [puzzle-xyz.com](https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com/)

A series of puzzle games, each with its own url. These puzzles are timed. Each puzzle configuration has a hall of fame where the best times are recorded. The owner / manager of the site expects programmatic solvers, and has a separate section in the hall of fame for them. If one is to believe that only the solve times listed under "Robots / programmatic solvers" actually used a programmatic solver, then the manual times are more impressive than the programmatic ones.

### [weavergame.org](https://weavergame.org/)

Although the url is weavergame.org, I call it "Word Weaver". The puzzle is untimed, which is good because the current implementation can sometimes take a couple minutes to complete.
